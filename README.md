# 📱 Device Assignment App

A small Ruby on Rails application for managing device assignments within an organization.  
This project was implemented as part of a recruitment task.

## ✅ Features

- Users can assign a device to themselves.
- A device can only be assigned to one active user at a time.
- A user cannot assign a device that is already assigned to someone else.
- Only the user who assigned a device can return it.
- Once a user returns a device, they can never re-assign the same device again.

---

## 🧠 Business Logic

- Devices are uniquely identified by their `serial_number`.
- Assignment and return operations are handled using service objects:
  - `AssignDeviceToUser`
  - `ReturnDeviceFromUser`
- Returned devices are tracked internally; no flag is used, only ownership and timestamps.
- Invalid operations raise custom error classes (`AssigningError`, `RegistrationError`).
